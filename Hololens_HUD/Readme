Operation steps for Hololens_HUD and issues fixation

For unity project:
  The Configuration
    1,Object and corresponding 
      Object[Quad](under Maincamera, Canvas) -- Script [DrawBoundingBoxes]{ Texture size: (recommended)500, 500. TextBoxPrefb: TextBox under Prefabs folder}
      Object[ScriptHolder] -- Script [Drawer]{DrawBoundingBoxes: the Quad shown above, Server: the ip address of Server.(Using ipconfig in windows to check), Port: (recommended)23939}
                           -- HLStreaming
      *Be sure to double check the server's IP. It can only be changed here.*
    2, The plugin(Under Assets/ Plugins(folder)):
      HLStreamer Unity Plugin.dll: SDK UWP; CPU ARM64
      HLStreamer Unity Plugin.winmd: SDK UWP; CPU AnyCPU
      The others: SDK: Any, CPU Any
      (Don't forget to click apply)
  Build:
    Target Device: HoloLens
    Architecture: ARM64
    Build and Run on: USB Device
    Build configuration: Debug
    Player Settings: -> Publishing Setting -> Certificate deselect
  After Built:
    Check https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/ptg-alphatesting/tree/streaming/Streaming/HLStreamerExample and replace codes in package file.
  Issues:
    1, The possible associated script cannot be loaded unity
      Fixation: remove all the scripts components and add them  to the correspoding game objects:
    2, Build issue with plugins:
      Fixation: Check HLStreamer Unity Plugin.dll configuration
Build and deploy in Hololens:
  1, USB cable connected Hololens and PC. Uninstall the previous app in HoloLens
  2, click Hololens HUD.sln. Change the configuration to Release, ARM64 and Device. (If want debugging choose debug)
  3, Build and deploy (if debugging build and directly click Device button)
  
  Possible Issues:
    1, In debug mode, Exception thrown in .exe Microsoft C++ exception: winrt::hresult_error at memory location
    (Ignore) Sill not finding solution, but it's harmless so far.
    2, Not responding for a long time (Longer than mins), check the connection of PC and Hololens

For Integration part:
  1, Keep PC and HoloLens both in same Network
  2, Firstly open the app in hololens. (If its in debug mode, that should be already opened)
  2, Using[ python main.py desktop --holo-ip 10.18.18.99 --send ] to initiate the python part (first located in that directory). 
  Check here 
    https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/ptg-alphatesting/tree/streaming/Streaming/python
    (The ip address could be changed. The local ip address in Hololens Setting for double checking)
    
  Possible issues:
    onnx file error: Download the file from https://github.com/onnx/models/blob/main/vision/object_detection_segmentation/yolov3/model/yolov3-10.onnx
      and manually drag that into python/asstes folder replace the old one.
    Not have bounding box in screen: check the Python output, if there is something wrong with onnx, do the same thing above.
									If you see "Listening: 0.0.0.0:23939" and "Awaiting connection..." but don't see a message "Connected: ({HoloLens_ip}, 5XXXX)", then check the firewall setting for Python.
